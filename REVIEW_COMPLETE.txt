================================================================================
                        QUICK WINS (Do First)
================================================================================

1. Input Validation (20 min) → Prevents crashes
2. Config Validation (30 min) → Catches errors early
3. Safe Mode (30 min) → Prevents accidents
4. Type Hints (2 hours) → Improves DX
5. API Security (45 min) → Protects system

TOTAL QUICK WINS: 4 hours 35 minutes

================================================================================
                       RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
1. Start with Issue #1: Configuration Validation (30 min)
   ├─ Easiest to implement
   ├─ Catches the most errors
   └─ Improves user experience immediately

2. Then do Issues #2-4 in order (2 hours)
   └─ All critical for production readiness

NEXT WEEK:
3. Implement Issues #5-8 (5.25 hours)
   └─ Improves reliability and maintainability

LATER:
4. Implement Features #1-10 (16.5 hours)
   └─ Nice-to-have improvements

================================================================================
                          KEY STRENGTHS
================================================================================

✅ Clean architecture with good separation of concerns
✅ Continuous wake word listening works well
✅ LLM routing logic is sound
✅ Good use of async/threading for non-blocking operations
✅ Flexible configuration system
✅ Comprehensive documentation

================================================================================
                          KEY WEAKNESSES
================================================================================

❌ Missing startup validation (catches errors too late)
❌ Weak API security (open CORS, no rate limiting)
❌ No input validation on API endpoints
❌ Missing confirmation flow for dangerous actions
❌ No timeout handling for slow LLM calls
❌ Microphone errors crash the listener
❌ Limited type hints and structured logging
